Problem
Chef and Chefina are residing in a hotel.

There are 1010 floors in the hotel and each floor consists of 1010 rooms.

Floor 11 consists of room numbers 11 to 1010.
Floor 22 consists of room numbers 1111 to 2020.
\ldots…
Floor ii consists of room numbers 10 \cdot (i-1) + 110⋅(i−1)+1 to 10 \cdot i10⋅i.
You know that Chef's room number is XX while Chefina's Room number is YY.
If Chef starts from his room, find the number of floors he needs to travel to reach Chefina's room.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers X, YX,Y, the room numbers of Chef and Chefina respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of floors Chef needs to travel to reach Chefina's room.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 10001≤T≤1000
1 \leq X, Y \leq 1001≤X,Y≤100
X \neq YX=Y

Explanation:
Test Case 11: Since Room 11 is on 1^{st}1 
st
  floor and Room 100100 is on 10^{th}10 
th
  floor, Chef needs to climb 99 floors to reach Chefina's Room.

Test Case 22: Since Room 4242 is on 5^{th}5 
th
  floor and Room 5050 is also on 5^{th}5 
th
  floor, Chef does not need to climb any floor.

Test Case 33: Since Room 5353 is on 6^{th}6 
th
  floor and Room 3030 is on 3^{rd}3 
rd
  floor, Chef needs to go down 33 floors to reach Chefina's Room.

Test Case 44: Since Room 8181 is on 9^{th}9 
th
  floor and Room 8080 is on 8^{th}8 
th
  floor, Chef needs to go down 11 floors to reach Chefina's Room.
  Solution
  
  /* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

		while(t-->0){
		    float x =sc.nextInt();
			float y =sc.nextInt();
			int z =(int)Math.ceil(x/10);
			int a=(int)Math.ceil(y/10);
			
			if(z>=a)
		    System.out.println(z-a);
		    else
		    System.out.println(a-z);
