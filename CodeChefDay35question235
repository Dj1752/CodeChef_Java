You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest.

There are 
�
N submissions, numbered 
1
1 through 
�
N. For each valid 
�
i, the 
�
i-th submission was submitted at time 
�
�
S 
i
​
  and judged at time 
�
�
J 
i
​
  (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than 
5
5 minutes.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer 
�
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of 
�
T test cases follows.
The first line of the input contains a single integer 
�
N.
�
N lines follow. For each valid 
�
i, the 
�
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers 
�
�
S 
i
​
  and 
�
�
J 
i
​
 .
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of submissions for which the judging was delayed by more than 5 minutes.

Explanation:
Example case 1: The delays of the respective submissions are 
2
2 minutes, 
0
0 minutes, 
6
6 minutes, 
10
10 minutes and 
5
5 minutes. Only submissions 
3
3 and 
4
4 are delayed by more than 
5
5 minutes, hence the answer is 
2
2.

Solution

/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int t =sc.nextInt();
		
		while(t-->0){
		    int t1 =sc.nextInt();
		     int count =0;
		  for(int i=0;i<t1;i++){
		      int x=sc.nextInt();
		      int y=sc.nextInt();
		     int res = y-x;
		     if(res>5){
		         count++;
		     }
		  }System.out.println(count);
		}
	}
}
