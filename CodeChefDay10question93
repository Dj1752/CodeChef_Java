Problem
Chef is given two integers AA and CC such that A \leq CA≤C.

Chef wants to find whether there exists any integer BB such that A, B,A,B, and CC are in arithmetic progression.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers AA and CC, the given integers.
Output Format
For each test case, output -1−1 if there exists no integer BB such that A, B,A,B, and CC are in arithmetic progression. Else, output the value of BB.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 601≤T≤60
1 \leq A \leq C \leq 101≤A≤C≤10

Explanation:
Test case 11: Considering B = 4B=4, the three integers are in arithmetic progression as B-A = C-B = 1B−A=C−B=1.

Test case 22: Considering B = 6B=6, the three integers are in arithmetic progression as B-A = C-B = 0B−A=C−B=0.

Test case 33: There exists no integral value of BB such that A, B,A,B, and CC are in arithmetic progression.

Test case 44: Considering B = 5B=5, the three integers are in arithmetic progression as B-A = C-B = 4B−A=C−B=4.

Solution

/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
			Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int t =sc.nextInt();
		
		for(int i =0;i<t;i++){
		    int x =sc.nextInt();
			int y =sc.nextInt();
			int c=(x+y)/2;
			if((c-x)==(y-c)){
			    System.out.println(c);
			}else{
			    System.out.println("-1");
			}
			   
			}
	
		  
		
	}
}
