Problem
Chef wants to give a burger party to all his NN friends i.e. he wants to buy one burger for each of his friends.

The cost of each burger is XX rupees while Chef has a total of KK rupees.

Determine whether he has enough money to buy a burger for each of his friends or not.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains the three integers NN, XX, and KK - the number of Chef's friends, the cost of each burger, and the total money Chef has, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if the Chef can give a party to all his NN friends. Otherwise, output NO.

You may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).

Explanation:
Test case 11: Chef has 55 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 10 \times 5 = 5010×5=50 while Chef has 7070 rupees. Therefore, he can buy a burger for all of them.

Test case 22: Chef has 55 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 10 \times 5 = 5010×5=50 while Chef has 4040 rupees. Therefore, he can not buy a burger for all of them.

Test case 33: Chef has 1010 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 40 \times 10 = 40040×10=400 and Chef has 400400 rupees. Therefore, he can buy a burger for all of them.

Test case 44: Chef has 1414 friends. The cost of buying a burger for each of them will be 14 \times 14 = 19614×14=196 while Chef has 150150 rupees. Therefore, he can not buy a burger for all of them.
