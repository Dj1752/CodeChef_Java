Problem
Chef is on his way to become the new big bull of the stock market but is a bit weak at calculating whether he made a profit or a loss on his deal.

Given that Chef bought the stock at value XX and sold it at value YY. Help him calculate whether he made a profit, loss, or was it a neutral deal.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two space-separated integers XX and YY, denoting the value at which Chef bought and sold the stock respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output PROFIT if Chef made a profit on the deal, LOSS if Chef incurred a loss on the deal, and NEUTRAL otherwise.

The checker is case-insensitive so answers like pROfiT, profit, and PROFIT would be considered the same.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 5001≤T≤500
1 \leq X, Y \leq 1001≤X,Y≤100
Sample 1:
Input

4
4 2
8 8
3 4
2 1

Output

LOSS
NEUTRAL
PROFIT
LOSS
Explanation:
Test case 11: Since the cost price is greater than the selling price, Chef made a loss in the deal.

Test case 22: Since the cost price is equal to the selling price, the deal was neutral.

Test case 33: Since the cost price is less than the selling price, Chef made a profit in the deal.

Test case 44: Since the cost price is greater than the selling price, Chef made a loss in the deal.

Solution
/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
		int t=sc.nextInt();
		for(int i=0;i<t;i++){
		    int x=sc.nextInt();
		    int y=sc.nextInt();
		    if(x>y){
		        System.out.println("LOSS");
		       
		    }else if(x==y){
		            System.out.println("NEUTRAL");
		        }else {
		            System.out.println("PROFIT");
		        }
		}
	}
}
