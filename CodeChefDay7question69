Explanation:
Test case 11: The damages require only Rs 33 lakh which is below the upper cap, so the entire Rs 33 lakh will be rebated.

Test case 22: The damages require Rs 88 lakh which is above the upper cap, so only Rs 55 lakh will be rebated.

Test case 33: The damages require only Rs 44 lakh which is equal to the upper cap, so the whole Rs 44 lakh will be rebated.

Test case 44: The damages require Rs 1515 lakh which is above the upper cap, so only Rs 1212 lakh will be rebated.
