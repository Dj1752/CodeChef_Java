Problem
In mathematics, the degree of polynomials in one variable is the highest power of the variable in the algebraic expression with non-zero coefficient.

Chef has a polynomial in one variable xx with NN terms. The polynomial looks like A_0\cdot x^0 + A_1\cdot x^1 + \ldots + A_{N-2}\cdot x^{N-2} + A_{N-1}\cdot x^{N-1}A

  for all (1\le i\le N)(1≤i≤N).

Find the degree of the polynomial.

Note: It is guaranteed that there exists at least one term with non-zero coefficient.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains of a single integer NN - the number of terms in the polynomial.
Second line of each test case contains of NN space-separated integers - the i^{th}i 
th
  integer A_{i-1}A 
i−1
​
  corresponds to the coefficient of x^{i-1}x 
i−1
 .
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the degree of the polynomial.

Explanation:
Test case 11: There is only one term x^0x 
0
  with coefficient 55. Thus, we are given a constant polynomial and the degree is 00.

Test case 22: The polynomial is -3\cdot x^0 + 3\cdot x^1 = -3 + 3\cdot x−3⋅x 
0
 +3⋅x 
1
 =−3+3⋅x. Thus, the highest power of xx with non-zero coefficient is 11.

Test case 33: The polynomial is 0\cdot x^0 + 0\cdot x^1 + 5\cdot x^2= 0+0 + 5\cdot x^20⋅x 
0
 +0⋅x 
1
 +5⋅x 
2
 =0+0+5⋅x

 . Thus, the highest power of xx with non-zero coefficient is 22.

Test case 44: The polynomial is 1\cdot x^0 + 2\cdot x^1+ 4\cdot x^2 + 0\cdot x^3= 1 + 2\cdot x + 4\cdot x^21⋅x 
0
 +2⋅x

 +4⋅x

 . Thus, the highest power of xx with non-zero coefficient is 22.
