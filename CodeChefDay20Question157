Problem
It is known that in regular dice, the sum of opposite faces is 77.

A regular dice is rolled and you are given the value XX showing on the top face. Determine the value on the bottom face.

Input Format
The first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only of each test case contains a single integer XX - the value on the top face.
Output Format
For each test case, output the value on the bottom face.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 61≤T≤6
1 \leq X \leq 61≤X≤6
Sample 1:

Output
3
3
1
6
4
6
1
Explanation:
Test case-1: The value on the top face is 33. Therefore, the value on the bottom face is 44 because 3 + 4 = 73+4=7.

Test case-2: The value on the top face is 11. Therefore, the value on the bottom face is 66 because 1 + 6 = 71+6=7.

Test case-3: The value on the top face is 66. Therefore, the value on the bottom face is 11 because 6 + 1 = 76+1=7.

Solution

/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int t =sc.nextInt();
		
		while(t-->0){
		    int x =sc.nextInt();
	
			 System.out.println(Math.abs(x-7));       
			}
		   
		 
		 
	}
