Problem
There are NN bikes and MM cars on the road.

Each bike has 22 tyres.
Each car has 44 tyres.
Find the total number of tyres on the road.

Input Format
The first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers N, MN,M.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the total number of tyres on the road.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 10001≤T≤1000
0 \leq N, M \leq 1000≤N,M≤100

Explanation:
Test Case 11: There are 22 bikes and 11 car. Each bike has 22 tyres, so there are 2\cdot 2 = 42⋅2=4 bike tyres. Similarly, each car has 44 tyres, so there are 1\cdot 4 = 41⋅4=4 car tyres. Adding the tyres of all vehicles, we get 4+4=84+4=8 tyres in total.

Test Case 22: There are 33 bikes and 00 cars. Each bike has 22 tyres, so there are 3\cdot 2 = 63⋅2=6 bike tyres. There are no cars, so there are 0\cdot 4 = 00⋅4=0 car tyres. Adding the tyres of all vehicles, we get 6+0=66+0=6 tyres in total.

Solution
/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int t=sc.nextInt();
		while(t-- > 0){
		    int a=sc.nextInt();
		    int b=sc.nextInt();
		    
		    int sum=a*2+b*4;
		    System.out.println(sum);
		    
		    
		}
	}
