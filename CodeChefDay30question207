 , the number of gold, silver and bronze medals won by two different countries respectively. Determine which country is ranked better on the leaderboard. It is guaranteed that there will not be a tie between the two countries.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers G_1G

 .

Output Format
For each test case, print "1" if the first country is ranked better or "2" otherwise. Output the answer without quotes.

Explanation:
Test case 11: Total medals for the first country are 10 + 20 + 30 = 6010+20+30=60 and that for the second country are 0 + 29 + 30 = 590+29+30=59. So the first country is ranked better than the second country.

Test case 22: Total medals for the first country are 0 + 0 + 0 = 00+0+0=0 and that for the second country are 0 + 0 + 1 = 10+0+1=1. So the second country is ranked better than the first country.

import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef

			int x1 =sc.nextInt();
		   int y1 =sc.nextInt();
			int z1 =sc.nextInt();
			int res=x+y+z;
			int res1 = x1+y1+z1;
			if(res>res1)
