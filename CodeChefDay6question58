Problem
Eikooc loves bread. She has NN loaves of bread, all of which expire after exactly MM days. She can eat upto KK loaves of bread in a day. Can she eat all the loaves of bread before they expire?

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line containing three integers NN, MM and KK - the number of loaves of bread Eikooc has, the number of days after which all the breads will expire and the number of loaves of bread Eikooc can eat in a day.
Output Format
For each test case, output Yes if it will be possible for Eikooc to eat all the loaves of bread before they expire. Otherwise output No.

You may print each character of Yes and No in uppercase or lowercase (for example, yes, yEs, YES will be considered identical).

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 10001≤T≤1000
1 \le N, M, K \le 1001≤N,M,K≤100

Output

100 100 1
9 2 5
19 6 3
Yes
Yes
No
Explanation:
Test case 1: Eikooc can eat one loaf of bread per day for 100100 days. Thus none of the bread expires.

Test case 2: Eikooc can eat 55 loaves of the first day and 44 loaves on the second day. Thus none of the bread expires.

Test case 3: There is no way Eikooc can consume all the loaves of bread before it expires.


Solution

/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int t=sc.nextInt();
		while(t-- >0){
		   	int x=sc.nextInt();
		   		int y=sc.nextInt();
		   			int z=sc.nextInt();
		   	if(x<=y*z)
		   	System.out.println("yes");
		   	else
		   	System.out.println("no");
		   
		}
