Problem
For encoding an even-length binary string into a sequence of A, T, C, and G, we iterate from left to right and replace the characters as follows:

00 is replaced with A
01 is replaced with T
10 is replaced with C
11 is replaced with G
Given a binary string SS of length NN (NN is even), find the encoded sequence.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
First line contains a single integer NN, the length of the sequence.
Second line contains binary string SS of length NN.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line the encoded sequence.

Note: Output is case-sensitive.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 1001≤T≤100
2 \leq N \leq 10^32≤N≤10 
3
 
NN is even.
Sum of NN over all test cases is at most 10^310

 .
SS contains only characters 0 and 1.

Explanation:
Test case 11: Based on the rules 00 is replaced with A.

Test case 22: Based on the rules 00 is replaced with A. Similarly, 11 is replaced with G. Thus, the encoded sequence is AG.

Test case 33: The first two characters are 10 which is encoded as C. Similarly, the next two characters 10 are encoded as C and the last two characters 10 are encoded as C. Thus, the encoded string is CCC.

Test case 44: The first two characters are 10 which is encoded as C. Similarly, the next two characters 01 are encoded as T. Thus, the encoded string is CT.
