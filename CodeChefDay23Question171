  day of week in Chefland is a sunny day, A_i = 0A 
i
​
 =0 denotes that the i^{th}i 
th
  day in Chefland is a rainy day. Determine if the weather report of Chefland is Good or not.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, 77 space separated integers A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7A
