Problem
There is a contest containing 22 problems AA and BB.

22 strong participants PP and QQ participated in the contest and solved both the problems.

PP made AC submissions on problems AA and BB at time instants P_AP 
A
​
  and P_BP 
B
​
  respectively while QQ made AC submissions on problems AA and BB at time instants Q_AQ 
A
​
  and Q_BQ 
B
​
 .

It is given that the time penalty is the minimum time instant at which a participant has solved both the problems. Also the participant with the lower time penalty will have a better rank.

Determine which participant got the better rank or if there is a TIE.

Input Format
The first line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line of input, four integers P_A, P_B, Q_A, Q_BP

Output Format
For each test case, output P if PP got a better rank, Q if QQ got a better rank, TIE otherwise.

Note that output is case-insensitive i.e. P and p both are considered the same.

Explanation:
Test Case 11:

Time penalty incurred by participant P = 10P=10.
Time penalty incurred by participant Q = 12Q=12.
Since 10 \lt 1210<12, PP gets a better rank.

Test Case 22:

Time penalty incurred by participant P = 30P=30.
Time penalty incurred by participant Q = 15Q=15.
Since 15 \lt 3015<30, QQ gets a better rank.

Test Case 33:

Time penalty incurred by participant P = 20P=20.
Time penalty incurred by participant Q = 20Q=20.
Since 20 = 2020=20, PP and QQ gets a same rank (TIE).

Test Case 44:

Time penalty incurred by participant P = 6P=6.
Time penalty incurred by participant Q = 6Q=6.
Since 6 = 66=6, PP and QQ gets a same rank (TIE).
