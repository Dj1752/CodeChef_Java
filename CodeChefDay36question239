In a season, each player has three statistics: runs, wickets, and catches. Given the season stats of two players 
�
A and 
�
B, denoted by 
�
R, 
�
W, and 
�
C respectively, the person who is better than the other in the most statistics is regarded as the better overall player. Tell who is better amongst 
�
A and 
�
B. It is known that in each statistic, the players have different values.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
�
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains two lines of input.
