Problem
Read problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is a very lazy person. Whatever work is supposed to be finished in xx units of time, he finishes it in m * xm∗x units of time. But there is always a limit to laziness, so he delays the work by at max dd units of time. Given x, m, dx,m,d, find the maximum time taken by Chef to complete the work.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains a single line of input, three integers x, m, dx,m,d.
Output Format
For each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 10^41≤T≤10 
4
 
1 \leq x, m \leq 101≤x,m≤10
0 \leq d \lt 1000≤d<100

Explanation:
TestCase 11: Chef takes 1 * 1 = 11∗1=1 unit of time which is equal to the upper bound(1 + 0 = 11+0=1 unit) to do the work.

TestCase 22: Chef takes min(1 * 3, 1 + 1) = min(3, 2) = 2min(1∗3,1+1)=min(3,2)=2 units of time to do the work.

TestCase 33: Chef takes 2 * 2 = 42∗2=4 units of time which is less than the upper bound(2 + 3 = 52+3=5 units) to do the work.

Solution
/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int t =sc.nextInt();
		
		while(t-->0){
		    int x =sc.nextInt();
			int y =sc.nextInt();
			int z =sc.nextInt();
		   int mul = x*y;
		   int sum = x+z;
		   
		   if(mul<=sum){
		       System.out.println(mul);
		   }else{
		       System.out.println(sum);
		   }
		}
	}
}
