Problem
Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.
Ash is trying to get visa to Chefland. For the visa to be approved, he needs to satisfy the following three criteria:

Solve at least x_1x 
1
​
  problems on Codechef.
Have at least y_1y 
1
​
  current rating on Codechef.
Make his last submission at most z_1z 
1
​
  months ago.
You are given the number of problems solved by Chef (x_2x 
2
​
 ), his current rating (y_2y 
2
​
 ) and the information that he made his last submission z_2z 
2
​
  months ago. Determine whether he will get the visa.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers x_1x 
1
​
 , x_2x 
2
​
 , y_1y 
1
​
 , y_2y 
2
​
 , z_1z 
1
​
  and z_2z 
2
​
 .
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if Chef will get the visa or "NO" if he will not.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).

Solution
/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;

import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef

			int x1 =sc.nextInt();
			int y =sc.nextInt();
			int y1 =sc.nextInt(); 
			int z =sc.nextInt();
			int z1 =sc.nextInt();
		    if((x1>=x)&&(y<=y1)&&(z>=z1))
		    System.out.println("yes");
