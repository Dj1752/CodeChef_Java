Explanation:
Test Case 11: Chef wants 33 items where the cost of each item is 44 rupees. To minimise the expenditure, Chef can pay for 22 items and get the third item for free. This way, the total money required is 4 \cdot 2 = 84⋅2=8 rupees.

Test Case 22: To minimise the expenditure, Chef can do the following:

Purchase 22 items for 2 \cdot 2 = 42⋅2=4 rupees and get the third one free. Thus, the total number of items is 33.
Purchase 11 item for 2 \cdot 1 = 22⋅1=2 rupees. Now Chef has total 44 items.
Thus, the minimum money required to buy 44 items is 4 + 2 = 64+2=6 rupees.

Test Case 33: To minimise the expenditure, Chef can do the following:

Purchase 22 items for 3 \cdot 2 = 63⋅2=6 rupees and get the third one free. Thus, the total number of items is 33.
Purchase 22 items for 3 \cdot 2 = 63⋅2=6 rupees. Chef gets a third item for free. Now Chef has total 66 items which is greater than his requirement of 55 items.
Chef wanted to buy at least 55 items. The minimum money required for that is 6 + 6 = 126+6=12 rupees.

Test Case 44: To minimise the expenditure, Chef can do the following:

Purchase 22 items for 1 \cdot 2 = 21⋅2=2 rupees and get the third one free. Thus, the total number of items is 33.
Purchase 22 items for 1 \cdot 2 = 21⋅2=2 rupees and get the third one free.. Now Chef has total 66 items.
Thus, the minimum money required to buy 66 items is 2 + 2 = 42+2=4 rupees.
