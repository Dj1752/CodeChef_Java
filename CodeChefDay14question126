Problem
Chef has made a list for his monthly expenses. The list has NN expenses with index 11 to NN. The money spent on each expense depends upon the monthly income of Chef.

Chef spends 50\%50% of his total income on the expense with index 11.
The money spent on the i^{th}i 
th
  expense (i>1)(i>1) is equal to 50\%50% of the amount remaining, after paying for all expenses with indices less than ii.
Given that Chef earns 2^X2 
X
  rupees in a month, find the amount he saves after paying for all NN expenses.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers NN and XX — where NN denotes the number of expenses and 2^X2 
X
  denotes the monthly income of Chef.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the amount saved by Chef after paying for all NN expenses.

Explanation:
Test case 11: The number of expenses are 11 and Chef's monthly income is 2^2 = 42 
2
 =4.
Chef spends 50\%50% of his monthly income, that is, 22 on first expense and saves the remaining amount 4-2 = 24−2=2.

Test case 22: The number of expenses are 11 and Chef's monthly income is 2^3 = 82 
3
 =8.
Chef spends 50\%50% of his monthly income, that is, 44 on first expense and saves the remaining amount 8-4 = 48−4=4.

Test case 33: The number of expenses are 22 and Chef's monthly income is 2^3 = 82 
3
 =8.

Chef spends 50\%50% of his monthly income, that is, 44 on first expense. The remaining amount is 8-4=48−4=4.
Chef spends 50\%50% of the remaining amount, that is, 22 on his second expense. The remaining amount is 4-2=24−2=2 which goes into his savings.
Test case 44: The number of expenses are 33 and Chef's monthly income is 2^4 = 162 
4
 =16.

Chef spends 50\%50% of his monthly income, that is, 88 on first expense. The remaining amount is 16-8=816−8=8.
Chef spends 50\%50% of the remaining amount, that is, 44 on second expense. The remaining amount is 8-4=48−4=4.
Chef spends 50\%50% of the remaining amount, that is, 22 on his third expense. The remaining amount is 4-2=24−2=2 which goes into his savings.
