Problem
In ChefLand, human brain speed is measured in bits per second (bps). Chef has a threshold limit of XX bits per second above which his calculations are prone to errors. If Chef is currently working at YY bits per second, is he prone to errors?

If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.

Input Format
The only line of input contains two space separated integers XX and YY — the threshold limit and the rate at which Chef is currently working at.

Output Format
If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yes, Yes, yEs, and YES will all be treated as identical).

Constraints
1 \leq X, Y \leq 1001≤X,Y≤100
Sample 1:
Input
Output
7 9
YES
Explanation:
Chef's current brain speed of 99 bps is greater than the threshold of 77 bps, hence Chef is prone to errors.


Solution
/* package codechef; // don't place package name! */

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

/* Name of the class has to be "Main" only if the class is public. */
class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x=sc.nextInt();
		int y=sc.nextInt();
		
		if(x<y){
		    System.out.println("YES");
		}else{
		    System.out.println("NO");
		}
	}
}
